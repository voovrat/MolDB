 # for periodic structures one has to begin with word CRYSTAL
 CRYSTAL

 # Then one needs to specify the lattice vectors
 # specification of PRIMVEC (in ANGSTROMS) like:
 #         ax, ay, az    (first lattice vector)
 #         bx, by, bz    (second lattice vector)
 #         cx, cy, cz    (third lattice vector)
 # pay attention to vectors as they are written in horizontal way which is quite unusual
 # for now only orthorhombic structures are allowed (free norms of lattice vectors, all angles are 90 degrees)
 PRIMVEC
   30.00000    0.00000    0.00000
    0.00000   30.00000    0.00000
    0.00000    0.00000   30.00000

 # Then one needs to specify the atoms belonging to the unit cell. 
 # First number stands for number of atoms in the primitive cell (2 in this case).
 # The second number is always 1 for PRIMCOORD coordinates.
 # in angstroms and cartesian coordinates
