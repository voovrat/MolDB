1. 
FHaims and RuNNer results are very similar.
Other methods have much more differences.

2.
FHaims looks like more-less as nwchem, abinit is different.
Explanation: FHaims and nwchem use non-periodic bases.

3. The differences between the methods are more visible if we plot the energy difference (protonated-neutral)
However, still we cannot say that the

4. However, if we look on the differences where the hydronium  is removed, the intuation is different.
We see, that FHaims and abinit give similar results while RuNNer have larger errors.

5. But the error does not depend on the water-water distances in the cluster

6. But depend on the distance to the hydronium
